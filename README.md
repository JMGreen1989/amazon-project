# React Amazon Clone - now with webpack

For this project, you will be trying to recreate Amazon's basic functionality. 


Functions:
- Should see items on the home page
- List Items based on last looked at Items (HINT: use categories)
- Items need to contain a price, a title, and a description. Anything else that you think need to be added, you can add.
- Need to be able to view the items details (can be either done in a modal or in a detail page)
- Need to be able to add the items to a cart and "checkout" (no payment processor should be used)
- Should be able to see other images of the item if available (no need for an image hosting service but if you want to include it, by all means)
- User should be able to sign up and/or sign in


Technologies that should be used:
- The back end is up to you. You can either use Ruby or Node.js
- Server side framework (Ruby on Rails or Express)
- Database (Can use SQL, NoSQL, or a local JSON file)
- React (you can either use .jsx or js)
- Redux
- (and of course) CSS or SASS


Directory should be structured as:
- client
  - src -> Where react files will be
    - actions
    - components
    - pages
    - reducers
    - constants
    - app.js(x)
  - public
    - index.html
- server
  - routes
    - controllers
    - handlers
  - models
  - middleware (if needed)
  - auth
